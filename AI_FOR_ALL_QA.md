## 1️⃣ What is the Problem Statement?

**Problem:** Small retail shop owners in India face significant challenges in managing their daily operations:

- **Customer Service Gaps:** Customers can't order when shop is closed or busy
- **No Business Insights:** Retailers don't know which products are profitable or what's selling
- **Bill Entry Overhead:** Manually entering wholesale bills takes 15-20 minutes per bill
